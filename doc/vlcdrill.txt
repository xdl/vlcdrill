INTRODUCTION                            *vlcdrill*

This plugin allows VLC streams to be defined in JSON format
'annotation' files and then exposes an interface to control
their playback.

ANNOTATION                              *vlcdrill-annotation*

The annotation JSON file consists of a 'playlist' key, holding
an array of <Stream>s:

  {
    "playlist": [
      <Stream>...
    ]
  }

Where `<Stream>` can be:

* `stream <string>` containing the path for the local file
or stream location of the song
* `{stream <string>, title <string>?, section <Section>?}` 

Where `<Section>` can be:

* `start_time <int>`, containing the start time of the section
* `[start_time <int>, description <string>]`

See the `example_annotations/` directory for more examples
(The `aimee_mann_youtube.json` is loaded by default, if one
isn't set in `g:vlcdrill#annotation#path`)

MAPPINGS                                *vlcdrill-mappings*

                                        *vlcdrill-:VlcDrillLoadAnnotation*
